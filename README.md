Counter-Strike: Global Offensive spectator guide
================================================

The source of the guide is in the `docs/` directory of this repository; if
you're just looking to read the guide, you'll want to follow this link:

http://qs-arno.github.io/csgo-spectator-guide/

This guide is intended to help new _spectators_ of the game.  In particular, it
is not designed to teach you to _play_ better (or at all, for that matter).
Learning to effectivly play CS: GO is a vast topic which has already been
covered in great detail by people much more qualified than I.

If you see something you think can be improved, by all means open an issue or
send a pull request.  In particular, I'm sure there will be some:

- Common terms missing from the glossary
- Bad/incomplete/incorrect definitions
- Typos and formatting errors

That said...if you think something needs a major overhaul or fundamental
change, feel free to open an issue if you like but be aware that I kinda
consider this thing to be my baby.  If you still think I'm full of it and want
to fork the repo to take it in your own direction, feel free; that's why I used
the AGPLv3 license.  Hell, if I think it's a good idea but just not the right
fit for my guide, I may even contribute to your fork.  :)
