<p>I'm going to divide this guide into multiple sections, designed to give a
progressively more in-depth understanding of the game.  There's two main
reasons for this: first of all, since there's a ton of terminology it allows
newbies to focus on what's important without getting buried by a bunch of
next-level meta that's almost never relevant, and secondly it gives someone
who's got their first game in front of them right now the chance to skim
something over quickly before the action starts.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, this guide is designed for people who are spectating
professional CSGO matches from major tournaments.  I'm aware there are rule
differences between these matches and more casual play, but I won't be covering
them to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-note-about-terminology">A quick note about terminology</h2>

<p>As with anything, getting the terminology down is by far the hardest part of
the learning process.  The "Before your first match" section deliberately uses
no game-specific terminology, and "Spectator 101" tries to keep it to an
absolute minimum.  After that, I'd recommend looking up terms individually as
you encounter them (either while reading later sections, or watching gameplay)
rather than trying to read/memorize the entire glossary at once; otherwise,
you're just going to get buried in terms and be overwhelmed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you could read it through once (with the understanding
that you won't retain most of it) just so the terms might seem a little more
familiar when you encounter them later, if you like.  Just be advised there are
<em>a lot</em> of terms, most of which you'll rarely encounter.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-expect-when-youre-spectating">What to expect when you're spectating</h2>

<p>These are the target audiences for each section of the guide.  We start from
literally no prior knowledge for the first section, through advanced tactics
and subtle nuances in the last one.<p>

<dl>

  <dt>Before Your First Match</dt>
  <dd>If you don't know anything about CSGO at all, start here.  If you care
      enough to be reading a guide, I'd say also read "Spectator 101" before
      you watch the match if possible; if you don't have time for that before
      the match starts, though, this section will at least give you a basic
      foothold so you're not completely bewildered.</dd>

  <dt>Spectator 101</dt>
  <dd>This tier of info is for new fans who want a basic idea of the strategy
      involved in the gameplay, as opposed to just enjoying the tactical
      execution.  Veterans will scoff at this tier as I gleefully omit tons of
      info that clearly adds to the experience, but at this level accessibility
      is paramount.</dd>

  <dt>The Newsletter Subscription</dt>
  <dd>This is where you're intrigued enough to want to really learn what's
      going on, and committed enough to spend some time doing it.  There's
      quite a bit of info here, but on the plus side you won't have to learn it
      a tidbit at a time just watching matches.</dd>

  <dt>Advanced Spec Strats</dt>
  <dd>In these sections, I dump the rest of what I've picked up, which is stuff
      that rarely comes up but is nice to know.  True veterans will probably
      still notice things missing, because I'm not a true veteran myself; I
      just went through this learning process and I'm excited enough about the
      game to want to make it accessible to others.  Patches welcome, as they
      say!</dd>

<h3 id="before-your-first-match">Before Your First Match</h3>

<p><strong><em>I'm about to sit down to my first "Counter-Strike: Global
Offensive" match and I know absolutely nothing; what can you tell me in a
couple of minutes?</em></strong></p>

<p>The most important info is in the first paragraph and they go down from
there, so read in order until the match starts.</p>

<p>CSGO is a team game (five players per side).  One side plays a group of
terrorists (usually called "the Ts" or "the T side" and represented by a
yellow/gold color) whose goal is to detonate a bomb at one of two
pre-determined sites on the map.  The other side plays a counter-terrorist
squad (usually called "the CTs" or "the CT side" and represented by a blue
color) whose goal is to prevent that detonation.</p>

<p>You can essentially break each round up into two phases: the first phase is
where the blue guys are trying to keep the yellow guys out of the two bomb site
areas (they're always called "A" and "B").  If the bomb never gets planted,
that's the only phase you get.  If the yellow guys do get the bomb planted,
then you have the second phase where they try to keep the blue guys from
getting in to defuse it.</p>

<p>These are the ways the terrorist team can win a round:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Eliminate all counter-terrorists before time runs out</li>
 <li>Plant the bomb, then defend it from defusal until it explodes</li>
</ol>

<p>These are the ways the counter-terrorist team can win a round:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Eliminate all terrorists before time runs out</li>
 <li>Defuse the bomb after it's been planted (it can't be "re-planted")</li>
 <li>Prevent planting of the bomb before time runs out</li>
</ol>

<p>Each player starts with a basic pistol and then uses in-game currency to buy
armor, grenades, and weapon upgrades at the beginning of each round.  Managing
this money is a huge part of the game that we're not getting into right now;
just be aware that each team's "economy" is important and is affected by how
well they do during each round (getting frags, winning the round, etc.).
Sometimes a player will do something that seems counter-productive in order to
have a better start in the next round (because they have more money).</p>

<p>Each map in CSGO is a "best of 30"; the first team to win 16 rounds is the
victor.  If the 30 rounds end in a 15-15 tie, "best of six" overtimes are
played until one team wins four rounds in a single overtime.</p>

<h3 id="spectator-101">Spectator 101</h3>

<p>A round where both sides are able to buy everything (or nearly everything)
they want is typically called a "gun round".  Any round where one side is
purchasing cheaper equipment in order to save money is expected to favor the
opposing team (the greater the spending disparity, the greater the
advantage).</p>

<h4>Phases of a round</h4>

<p>Each round begins with freeze time (typically 15 seconds) where players
cannot move, and can buy equipment.  Then the main round timer starts
(typically 1:50).  This timer counts down to zero and the round ends as a
counter-terrorist victory, unless the bomb is planted.  If the bomb is planted,
any time on the main timer is disregarded and a 40-second invisible timer
counts down to zero and the round ends as a terrorist victory, unless the bomb
is defused (a defusal is an immediate counter-terrorist victory).</p>

<h3 id="rules-variations">Rules variations</h3>

<h4 id="rules-variations-overtime">Overtime</h4>

<ul>
 <li>Different overtime rules given as "MRx/yK"</li>
 <li>x: The number of rounds per half.</li>
 <li>y: The amount of money each team starts with (in thousands of
 dollars).</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, "MR3/16K" means that four rounds are required to win ("best of
six"), and each team starts with $16,000 per player.  Players still accrue
money as normal and the amounts reset at the beginning of each overtime (e.g.
if the game goes to OT2, OT3, etc.).</p>

<h4 id="rules-variations-coaching">Coaching</h4>

<p>I don't know what "Valve rules" are, but I heard an ESL caster use the term.
There are different rules for when coaches can talk.  For example, at DreamHack
coaches are allowed to talk during freeze time (Valve rules: only at
halftime?).</p>

<p>The rules dictate when a coach may talk to the players; these are the different
"phases" that different rules will allow/deny:</p>

<ul>
 <li>During a time out</li>
 <li>Between rounds / during freeze time</li>
 <li>During gameplay</li>

<h3 id="glossary-terms">Terms</h3>

<dl class="glossary inline">

 <dt id="glossary-200-iq">200 IQ</dt>
 <dd>A phrase to describe something (usually a play) that shows extraordinary
 anticipation and/or situational awareness.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-3k">3K</dt>
 <dd>A situation where a player frags three members of the enemy team.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-4k">4K</dt>

 <dd>See "ace"</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-ace">ace</dt>
 <dd>A situation where a player frags all five members of the enemy team.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-aggressive-spot">aggressive spot</dt>
 <dd>A place on the map considered higher risk/higher reward.  The idea is
 that placing yourself in a more dangerous spot (fewer exits, less cover)
 makes your presence there unexpected, giving you an edge in split-second
 reaction situations.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-aggro">aggro</dt>
 <dd>The attention of the enemy team.  Usually used in the phrase "draw aggro",
 e.g. when someone "draws aggro" they've captured the other team's attention
 (when done deliberately, it's usually intended as a diversion).</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-aim-punch">aim punch</dt>
 <dd>Something to do with some weapons' ability to kill an opponent with a
 single head shot if they're not wearing a helmet.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-angle">angle</dt>
 <dd>A particular sight line.  Usually used as "hold an angle", referring to
 the act of keeping a weapon trained down a sight line in anticipation of
 enemy activity.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-anti-eco">anti-eco</dt>
 <dd>An "anti-eco strategy" is a strategy designed to exploit the weaknesses of
 an opposing team that has weaker weapons and/or less utility, while also
 minimizing the chance of unnecessary casualties (especially since .</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-armor">armor</dt>
 <dd>Collectively refers to the helmet and Kevlar body armor.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-assist">assist</dt>
 <dd>To do damage to an opponent that a teammate ultimately frags.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-bait-out">bait out</dt>
 <dd>To engage in a strategy that causes the opponent to perform a desired
 action.  For example, making the opponent throw a grenade is typically
 called "baiting out utility".  Peeking around corners of the map to attract
 sniper fire can be "baiting out the AWP", and making a bomb site look
 undefended is a way to "bait out a terrorist push".  Also "draw out".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-blind">blind</dt>
 <dd>Unable to see (usually because of a flashbang grenade).</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-bomb-down">bomb down</dt>
 <dd>Sometimes refers to a bomb plant (in that case, it's usually phrased as
 "get the bomb down"), but usually refers to a situation where the bomb has
 been inadvertently dropped (e.g. the player carrying it was fragged).</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-boost">boost</dt>
 <dd>A tactic where a player will stand on a teammate's shoulders, in order to
 get a better view or to jump over a tall obstacle.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-broken">broken</dt>
 <dd>Usually refers to a situation where a team doesn't have enough money to
 avoid taking an eco round.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-buy-time">buy time</dt>
 <dd>See freeze time.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-clean-frag">clean frag</dt>
 <dd>A frag accomplished with minimal damage taken.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-clutch">clutch</dt>
 <dd>A play/situation where a player succeeds against the odds.  Usually used
 when the last remaining player wins the round against multiple opponents,
 e.g. a "1v3 clutch".  As a verb: "clutching it out".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-contact-play">contact play</dt>
 <dd>An aggressive play relying on execution skill.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-deathmatch">deathmatch</dt>
 <dd>A reference to a more traditional type of first-person shooter game;
 used to describe situations where the gameplay seems to ignore the overall
 Counter-Strike objectives about the bomb planting/defusal and just focuses on
 winning by eliminating the other team.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-default-pistols">default pistols</dt>
 <dd>The pistols the players start each round with when they don't bring any
 weapons through from the previous round.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-default-plant">default plant</dt>
 <dd>The most common location to plant the bomb at a given bomb site.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-defuse-kit">defuse kit</dt>
 <dd>A piece of equipment a counter-terrorist player can buy that reduces the
 time required for bomb defusal from the default 10 seconds to five seconds.  
 Also "kit".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-demo">demo</dt>
 <dd>A gameplay recording that plays back in the game engine itself.  Contrast
 with a VOD, which is a traditional media file.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-dink">dink</dt>
 <dd>A non-fatal head shot (usually due to a player's helmet).</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-dm">dm</dt>
 <dd>See "deathmatch".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-eco-round">eco round</dt>
 <dd>Short for "economy round".  Refers to a round where equipment purchases
 are minimized, so as to save money for use in subsequent rounds.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-economy-damage">economy damage</dt>
 <dd>In addition to the more obvious benefits of eliminating an opponent, an
 opponent who is fragged will have to buy new weapons/armor/utility the next
 round.  Forcing this extra expenditure can be called "damaging the economy" of
 the opposing team.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-entry-frag">entry frag</dt>
 <dd>A frag at the beginning of a tactical execution, usually (but not always)
 as the first frag of a round.  Sometimes "entry".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-execution">execution</dt>
 <dd>An implementation of a strategy/tactic.  "They've got a B rush strat,
 starting the execution now..."  Also "exec".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-exit-frag">exit frag</dt>
 <dd>A frag performed while leaving an area against opponents entering that
 area; usually refers to frags from terrorists leaving the bomb site against
 the counter-terrorists coming to defuse the bomb.  Sometimes shortened to
 "exit".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-fake-defuse">fake defuse</dt>
 <dd>A tactic where a counter-terrorist player starts a defusal and immediately
 stops.  When defusal starts, a specific sound is made; during defusal, the
 player is defenseless so a fake defusal can be used to draw out opponents for
 an ambush.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-flashbang-grenade">flashbang grenade</dt>
 <dd>A grenade that does minimal damage, but temporarily impairs vision and
 hearing.  If you're looking directly at the explosion, your view will be
 completely blocked for a couple of seconds (the spectator POV view never goes
 fully opaque, but will indicate when the player's actual view is completely
 occluded).  Also "flash", "flashbang".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-flash-in">flash in</dt>
 <dd>The act of using a flashbang to assist with a teammate's (or your own)
 entrance into an area.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-flick-shot">flick shot</dt>
 <dd>A shot requiring very fast (almost instantaneous) mouse movement.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-force-buy">force buy</dt>
 <dd>A situation where a player/team doesn't have enough money to buy all the
 desired equipment (a "full buy"), but buys some equipment anyway to make a
 victory more likely.  This is as opposed to an "eco round" where almost no
 money is spent so that a full buy is possible on the following round.  Often
 shortened to "force", as in "the counter-terrorists are going to force this
 round".<dd>

 <dt id="glossary-frag">frag</dt>
 <dd>Also "kill".  Also "find", as in "good find by &lt;player&gt;".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-freeze-time">freeze time</dt>
 <dd>The period at the beginning of the round when players can buy equipment;
 so named because movement is disabled.  Also "buy time".</dd>

 hazards reduces your health.  Armor causes your health to drop more slowly as
 you take damage.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-helmet">helmet</dt>

 "they won the knife so they get to pick their starting side".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-leg">leg</dt>

 time.  Primarily used to deny access to an area/passageway or to flush out a
 hiding player, but occasionally also for direct damage.  Terrorist teams will
 sometimes throw a Molotov Cocktail on top of a planted bomb, to postpone
 defusal by the counter-terrorists.  The flame visual effect does obscure
 vision, although only to a minor degree.  Also "molly".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-no-scope">no-scope</dt>

 in good shape".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-pixel-shot">pixel shot</dt>
 <dd>A shot landed when very little of the opponent was visible (e.g. because

 shortened to "post-plant".  "If they use up all their grenades, they're going
 to be in trouble in the post-plant."  Also as an adjective: "this is our post-plant
 strategy".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-pre-fire">pre-fire</dt>
 <dd>Firing your weapon without actually looking for a target first.  Usually

 after the bomb is planted.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-reset">reset</dt>

 <dd>See "eco round".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-save">save</dt>

 they know they can't defuse the bomb so they're going to save."</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-scoped-in">scoped in</dt>
 <dd>To be using the scope on a weapon that has one; usually used in reference
 to the AWP sniper rifle.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-smoke-grenade">smoke grenade</dt>
 <dd>A tactical grenade that does no damage, but visually obscures an area.
 Typically used for safe passage across enemy weapon sight lines, as well as
 "walling off" an area to prevent long-range weapon damage (for example when
 planting a bomb).  It's fairly usual to see both sides use smoke grenades in
 a bomb plant situation to obscure their position while planting or defusing,
 since both actions leave the player unable to attack.  Also "smoke".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-splash-damage">splash damage</dt>
 <dd>Damage dealt by a weapon beyond what's caused by a direct hit.  In CSGO,
 this only comes up in reference to grenades.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-spray">spray</dt>

 The amount of each spray is limited by the individual weapon's magazine
 size.</dd>

 burst.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-stack">stack</dt>
 <dd>A situation where multiple teammates are together.  "They're hitting the A
 site with a three-man stack", etc.  Note that despite the normal meaning of
 the word, this does not imply that the players are vertically stacked (on
 each other's shoulders): the term for that is "boost".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-strat">strat</dt>
 <dd>Short for "strategy".  A noun describing a particular strategy, usually in
 terms of its applicability ("this is our best re-take strat here").  Common
 usages are "default strat" to describe a tried and true basic execution for a
 given map/situation, and "scrimmy strat" to describe something too unreliable
 to use in a serious game (although on occasion those strats do work well as a
 surprise).  A common strat-related term is "full execute", which describes an
 execution with full weapons and utility.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-tactical-pause">tactical pause</dt>
 <dd>Another term for a time out.  Time outs typically last 30 seconds, and can
 only be taken during freeze time.  In most tournaments, the other team is not
 allowed to communicate during the time out.  In most tournaments, this is the
 only opportunity the players have to talk with their coach (the notable
 exception is DreamHack tournaments, where coaches can also talk during freeze
 time).</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-tap">tap</dt>
 <dd>Usually refers to a single shot.  More generally, shooting a weapon
 without holding the fire button.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-team-ace">team ace</dt>

 <dd>The act of affecting your own teammates with a flashbang.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-technical-pause">technical pause</dt>
 <dd>A pause initiated by event staff due to equipment issues.  While these
 pauses are usually shown as "attached" to a team based on the player that
 reported the problem, that's not a useful distinction since the technical
 issues are a function of the venue and not of either team.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-tilt">tilt</dt>
 <dd>To "be tilted" indicates frustration.  To "tilt someone" means to do
 something that makes them frustrated.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-tk">TK</dt>
 <dd>See "team kill".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-smoke-out">smoke out</dt>
 <dd>To "smoke someone out" means to use a smoke grenade to block off their
 view of a particular area.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-team-kill">team kill</dt>
 <dd>Usually "TK".  A frag resulting from "friendly fire" damage from a
  teammate.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-telegraph">telegraph</dt>
 <dd>To make something obvious to the opponent.  Usually in the form "the play
 was telegraphed", referring to a tactic that's easy for the opponent to
 anticipate due to clues given inadvertently.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-trade">trade</dt>
 <dd>A follow-up frag of an opponent who just fragged a teammate.  A trade frag
 is usually easier due to having a much better idea of the opponent's position,
 as well as the fact that the opponent no longer has a full magazine.</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-trigger-discipline">trigger discipline</dt>
 <dd>The ability to delay taking a shot at an opponent when that delay allows
 the player to observe more details about the opposing team's strategy.</dd>

 to your being in an unexpected position).</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-wrap-around">wrap around</dt>
 <dd>The act of taking a long route around a map in order to attack the
 opponent from an unexpected place.  Sometimes just "wrap".</dd>

 <dt id="glossary-xvy">XvY</dt>
 <dd>As "1v1", "1v2", "3v4", etc.  Refers to the number of players remaining on
 each side.</dd>

</dl>

<h3 id="glossary-phrasing-decoded">Phrasing, decoded</h3>

<p>For the stuff in this section, it's assumed that you already know what the
individual words mean, but the usage is strange enough that it still doesn't
quite make sense or is ambiguous.  Below are some phrases I've heard casters
use that I thought a newbie might have trouble with.</p>

<p>Players are sometimes referred to by an item they carry.  For example,
you'll hear phrases like "The bomb is headed toward A.", "The AWP is
repositioning to a better angle.", or "The rifles are sneaking around while the
pistol makes some noise to distract the CTs."</p>

<p>Last but not least, here's a random grab-bag of phrases that I've
encountered "in the wild" that seemed like good candidates for translation:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>"get some guns down on exit"</dt>
 <dd>Perform exit frags to damage opponent's economy</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="suggestions-for-new-spectator-features">Suggestions for new spectator features</h2>

<p>This section actually has nothing to do with the guide, it's just a place
for me to collect my spectator-experience improvement ideas.  Stuff in the
"Stream" section are things I'd imagine a broadcaster (such as ESL) could do
pretty easily with stream overlays.  If I think it's not reasonable to do it
that way and requires actual cooperation from the game client, I put it in the
"In-game" section.  Then we've got the "Tournament" section which probably
aren't gamecast UI suggestions at all, but things in the real meatspace
world.</p>

<h3 id="suggestions-stream">Stream</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Put decals on the walls with the names of different callouts.  For
 example, the words "Brown Halls" plastered across a wall in the relevant area
 of Train.</li>
 <li>Show the name of the purchased gun (instead of just the picture)</li>
 <li>Show the investment level of each side in the UI.  Full buy, eco, hard
 eco, full eco, etc.</li>
 <li>Show the "sided-ness" of each map (i.e. whether it's a CT-sided or T-sided
 map).  Obviously this is a judgment call and may change as the meta changes;
 that's why you're the experts.  :)</li>
 <li>Show each player's money, as well as the team's overall money, in the
 permanent UI.  For overall money I'd say this is best accomplished by
 modifying the existing horizontal bar across the top.  Per-player money could
 go next to the health number.</li>
 <li>Colorized health bars (e.g. the bar is one color at 100%, another color if
 they're at least 75%, below 25%, etc.)</li>
 <li>Or, maybe the colors in the health bar should be in two sections, to
 demonstrate the damage-reducing effect of the body armor</li>
 <li>An actual, numeric bomb timer that changes color based on which type of
 defuse
 is still possible (10-seconds, 5-second, none)</li>
 <li>Show the target round count in OT ("first to 19", "first to 22",
 etc.)</li>
 <li>Show loss bonus [when? / what format?]</li>
 <li>Show remaining time outs</li>
 <li>Make the POV player's name much larger and bolder so that the color is
 obvious out of the corner of your eye.  The idea is that without a very deep
 knowledge of the game, when the POV switches you're not immediately going to
 know which team the person is on.  Conveying that without making the person
 look away from the center of the screen means they know whether that X-ray
 silhouette coming around the corner is a teammate or a target</li>
 <li>After a player dies, show their death information where the health info
 goes (killer, weapon used, map area, head shot)
</ul>

<p>Would love to see a "deep dive" where you take a game
(possibly just a VOD of an existing match) and do an in-depth analysis after
each individual round where you go through and dissect each round to discuss
what the players were (probably) thinking at any given moment.</p>

<p>How about a series of VODs for each map to outline decent tactics that a new
player can execute?  This relates to spectating in the sense that knowing what
good players tend to do at the beginning (i.e. before the specifics of the game
in progress have to be accounted for) helps understanding of the different sets
of tactics.</p>

<h3 id="suggestions-in-game">In-game</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Multi-screen spectating (multiple player views, real-time stats view,
 etc.)</li>
 <li>Show grenade results in mini-map</li>
 <li>Colorize the timer when a bomb plant is impossible (i.e. when the timer
 gets below four seconds)</li>
 <li>Actually make timeouts a game feature (server determines number, length,
 and whether the other team's voice/text chat gets disabled)</li>
 <li>Actually make map pool, ban/pick process, and map sets ("best of X") game
 features</li>
 <li>Actually make the knife round and subsequent team-side choice a game
 feature</li>
 <li>Allow the server to "control" map annotations the same way it controls
 your spectator POV, X-ray, etc. (this only really becomes useful with
 multi-screen spectating where you've got the mini-map open in a separate
 window)</li>
 <li>Style the health bar to show recent damage (like in other games, where
 chunks of the health bar go red for a second before disappearing).  Same for
 the skulls on dead characters (e.g. for AWP head shots).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="suggestions-tournament">Tournament</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Player nameplates on the backs of the monitors, and on the wall behind
 them (or maybe on the chair's headrest) so you can see them in the close
 shots.  You're trying to "personalize" the players, which is great, but
 actually learning their names (well, their handles) would be <em>slightly</em>
 easier with repeated exposure.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="suggestions-replays-demos">Replays (demos)</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Bookmarks
  <ul>
   <li>Manual ("this is where so-and-so did something amazing")</li>
   <li>Automatic
    <ul>
     <li>Frags</li>
     <li>Bomb plant</li>
     <li>Bomb dropped after first 15 seconds</li>
     <li>X frags in Y seconds</li>
     <li>Long-range AWP no-scope</li>
     <li>Long-range head shot</li>
     <li>Flick shot (threshold for mouse velocity leading up to shot)</li>
     <li>1vX conversions (where X is at least 3 I guess?)</li>
     <li>Frag through smoke</li>
     <li>Frag while blinded</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Both types of bookmarks have metadata "tags"; manual bookmarks also
    have free text.  The same timestamp can have multiple bookmarks associated
    with it.  Tags include things like "no-scope", "clutch", etc.</li>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Auto-casting
  <ul>
   <li>Just a few very basic things at first</li>
   <li>Text-to-speech for annotated bookmarks</li>
   <li>Voice packs for automatic bookmarks</li>
   <li>Player name pronunciations embedded in replay metadata using something
   like <a href="http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/">IPA</a></li>
   <li>Automatic glossary for auto-casted terms, as well as specific terms
   pattern-matched out of the free text in the bookmark annotations.  This
   would be used to explain why a particular event significant (e.g. "why is an
   AWP no-scope such a big deal?").</li>

<h4>Stylus style to hide Twitch player spoilers</h4>

<p>IMO the best site to watch CSGO VODs is
<a href="https://eventvods.com/">Eventvods</a>; they put a lot of effort into
making sure you can watch all the matches in a tournament without spoilers.
Obviously you still have to watch the matches in order, in case the casters
discuss previous match results in conversation (you'll find this happens a
lot).<p>

<p>There is one place where spoilers can creep into the Eventvods experience,
and that's in the actual VOD player UI itself (e.g. the Twitch/YouTube embedded
player's UI).  Both players show the video's total time and a horizontal slider
that shows progress; normally you want those but knowing how much time is left
in the VOD can be a spoiler.  Imagine it's 15-14 in the second map of a Bo3
match, and you know there's only two minutes left in the VOD; it's pretty
obvious who's going to win at that point.  I'm not sure if this is something
Eventvods can fix on their end, but either way, here's a userstyle for the
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us">Stylus userstyle manager</a>
that hides those UI elements in the embedded Twitch player.  Note that this
will hide them in <em>all</em> Twitch players, so it's up to you how/when/if
you want to use it.</p>
